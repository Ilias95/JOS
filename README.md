JOS
===
This repository contains my solutions to the open programming labs of MIT's Operating Systems Engineering [6.828 course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/overview.html). This series of labs allows people to get experience with operating systems by developing a toy kernel in C for x86 CPUs called JOS.

Among other things I had to write parts of the implementation for managing page tables, setting up the Interrupt Descriptor Table, performing round-robin scheduling and supporting SMP. Additionally, I had to implement a simple disk file system and a network driver for the E1000 card.
